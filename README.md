# Z-index
Having issues with Z-index and other CSS properties.
 
## This is a small fictional frontend webpage.
I am having issues with Z-index property ,responsiveness, navigation bar and the slide buttons, below are the details of the issues.

### 1) Navigtion bar issue.

When the webpage is opened(inspected) in ipad or smartphone sizes the contents in the navigation bar get included in the *toggler-button* except the navbar-brand **Tindog**, the problem is that the *toggler-button* gets out of the navbar i.e down of the navbar-brand **Tindog** ,I don't want it to get down and also tried the bootstrap class,   <sub>Fixed- top</sub>.

### 2) Issue with responsiveness of the webpage .

when the page is inspected for responsiveness,I see that there is a *white space on the right side* of the page and is unresponsive.

### 3) Z-index issue with the iphone6 image.

I want the features seection of my webpage to ovelap a bit on the home page so that the iphone image looks like it has been cut a little bit from the bottom.
Below is the screenshot from the code.You can see that I have commented out the z-index styling, when I apply this styling the iphone image gets bigger and gets out of the flow.

### 4) Slide buttons Isssue.

The *slide buttons* for the Carousel isn't working properly ,the *previous button (<)* is functioning as a next button and the *next button(>)* functions as a previous button.Also when inspected for responsiveness and when the width of the screen goes on increasing the buttons start moving closer to each other, and when the width of the screen goes on decreasing the right button starts moving away.
